# Emotion-Caluclator
A personal emotion calculator program created in Python to demonstrate basic knowledge of the Python language. This code gives users the opportunity to input their emotional level based on a numeric scale, then allow for more users to input their own individual statistics. The program documents this in a series of prompts, and ultimately keeps tract of how many people have been prompted.
(My very first Python3 programming project!)
